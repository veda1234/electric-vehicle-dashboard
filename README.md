## Project summary
This project investigates how electric vehicles are related to other entities of society: mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and
gasoline prices. We develop a dashboard that showcases these relationships, as a proponent for electric cars. Additionally, we develop models
to see if we are able to predict EV counts from these entities.
